We are using GitHub as its built-in support for "issues" works well as our desired community-maintained list of internal EA "issues."

You can go to the ["Issues" tab](https://github.com/zhempstead/ea_redteam_example/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to see what others are discussing. If you create a free GitHub account, you can comment, upvote, or even create your own issue! You will be guided through the process by a template after clicking the "New issue" button in the top right.
