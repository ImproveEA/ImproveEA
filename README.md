# Improving EA
Welcome! We are a group of people in the Effective Altruist community who believe that EA community members can improve the EA movement more effectively.

One of the many positive aspects about the EA community is its openness to criticism and feedback. However, we've noticed a common pattern on the [EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/):
- Someone posts a thoughtful piece of criticism
- There is a lot of great discussion
- The piece leaves the front page after a few days
- People move on, and nothing changes

We are hoping to improve on this by maintaining a visible, community-created list of issues internal to the EA movement, complete with community-proposed solutions and direct action campaigns (where appropriate).
